Please be aware that this website can only be fully functional when cloned and run locally on your computer. Unfortunately, the NewsAPI.org service, which provides the news data for this website, is blocked on GitHub Pages, the hosting service used for this repository's live deployment.
**CORS Restrictions**: Some APIs have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions, which can affect whether your website can make requests to the API from different origins. When you run your website locally from your computer, it might not encounter CORS issues, but when deployed to GitHub Pages, it might. Check the API's documentation for CORS information and make sure it allows requests from your GitHub Pages domain.
